1.1
log
@The VirtualDisk tests now work.
There was a lot of code duplicated in various files in order to set up a virtual blockfile.
I created a class TestUtils that contains some utilities to help create virtual blockfiles, etc.
Add to that file any functions that are needed by more than one unit class.

The cleanup of tmp files is also done in syg_unittest.cpp.
