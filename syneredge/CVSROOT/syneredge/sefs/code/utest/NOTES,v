@Note for testing:

I added a file "testOrder.cpp" through which you can control the order of testing of modules.
The reason for doing this is so that lower-level modules could be tested before higher-level
ones. 

If you add a registration statement in this file, you should not add it to an individual
file.

utestlog.txt contains the results from the test run before the last checkin.

log
@These are partially converted tests. Many will break because of the changes
to how readBlock and writeBlock behave -- they will fail if blocks are
not allocated.

testOrder.cpp controls the order of tests.
