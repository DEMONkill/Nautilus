    Installing MySQL 5.0 on Linux

MySQL 5.0.x can be installed on Linux by going to the mysql
website and from there go to their "Products" area.  From
there go to "Downloads" and choose the appropriate platform.
Download both the Server and Client RPMs.  Then, as root,
execute the following commands:

    rpm --install MySQL-server-5.0.2-0.i386.rpm
    rpm --install MySQL-client-5.0.2-0.i386.rpm

Note that the sub-version may vary. (5.0.2, 5.0.4, etc.)



To build the sefs policy engine, the include files and MySQL
libraries are also needed. To get them, go to the download
web page.  On the download web page, download:

    Linux (x86, glibc-2.2, static, gcc)    Standard   5.0.4-beta

Unpack the tarball.  Within this is a script
"bin/mysql_config" that generates the proper compilation and
link options for your system.  To compile a source file, add
the bin directory to your path and do as in these examples:

    gcc -c foo.c -o foo.o `mysql_config --cflags`    # use gcc for C
    g++ -c foo.cpp -o foo.o `mysql_config --cflags`  # use g++ for C++

example of linking:

    g++ -o foo foo.o `mysql_config --libs`



The mysql main website is:

    http://www.mysql.com/


The download web page is at:

    http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html
