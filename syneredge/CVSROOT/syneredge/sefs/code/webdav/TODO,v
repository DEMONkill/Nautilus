@GENERAL
-------

- web page needs to get done:
	- Download
	- News
	- TODO list
	- Changes
	- Name

MOVE
----

needs to get implemented (will get used for renaming files and dirs)


PROPFIND
--------

- PROPNAMES need to get implemented
- only DAV properties are possible right now
- Depth=infinity should be implemented


GET
---

- guessing type?


HEAD
----

to be done


PROPPATCH
---------

to be done (not that important as only DAV props are supported right now which
you cannot change)

data.py
-------

- implement proppatch? As example we might use some sort of database for 
  storing..  (to much trouble for a simple example? Better show it with 
  the groupware stuff?)


PROBLEMS
--------

- put does not work the first time when using cadaver. Have to test this with
  other clients. When trying a second time it works...
