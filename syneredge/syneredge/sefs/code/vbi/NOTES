1. I want to make unit tests classes be able to call private functions of the 
   class they are testing. How to make them a friend?
	E.g., BlockCacheStd.hpp

	FIXED -- Atul.

2. There is an issue that the virtual disk class does not know if a block is free. It is possible
	to cause RELEASE on a block that was not previously allocated successfully since the release
	operation first goes to the cache. Cache does not always know if a block was allocated, since
	allocation information is kept at the VirtualBlockFile and BlockFile level, and not propagated
	up.

	It may be possible to query the lower-levels for the block status first before freeing it up.
	
	TO INVESTIGATE LATER.

3. Change int to unsigned int (uint)
4. Change int64 to uint64.
5. Check for wraparound with integers where addition is done.
