The modular approach
--------------------

One thing GROUP.lounge should one day also have is:

- an event planner
- an address book
- an bookmark database

and so on.


The one approach is to implement all this directly into GROUP.lounge and
the other one is to do it not. The disadvantage of the first approach is
that no other application then has access to the data of all these modules.
And thus the second approach is the better one.

In this approach we will implement all these modules in separate programs
which can interact with each other via CORBA. Of course this would then
only be data exchange and no GUI etc. which is shared but that should be
enough. 

What needs to get defined is:

- the concept of the API of these modules
- a logical concept of the architecture (what is done in the module
  what must be done in the application? etc.)
