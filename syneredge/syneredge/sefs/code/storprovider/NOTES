1. when writing a block to disk using operator<<, size > 0.

2. All blocks in a blockfile must be of the same size.

3. When reading a block using >>, the size > 0.

4. Possible optimization: Dealing with small writes. Currently, a small
   write would translate to the writing of a whole 1024 byte block.

5. numBytes: indicates valid bytes in a block -- such as last block
   in a file.
  Design alternative: not maintain numBytes. Maintain partial block
     information in BlockFile.

6. To BlockFile, open: Should check existence of the freeblockmap file and that it readable/writeable.

7. Check all the bounds > vs. >=. Add Unit Tests for that.

8. in iBlockIO.hpp, should getNumBlocks and getNumFreeBlocks() be const
	functions, like getFileName()?
